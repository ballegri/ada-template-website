# Why is it important ?

In recent years, the US movie industry has often been criticised in the media for its lack of female representation. As a simple and quick example: type 'most famous wizardess' in a Google research bar. Google automatically suggests 'most famous wizard' and not wizardess. By clicking on the first link provided (https://faceoffdb.com/lists/powerful-wizards-and-witches/), a ranking of the top 45 most famous widards/wizardesses is given with only **one** woman in the top 10. In the Wikipedia "Bechdel test" page (measure of the representation of women in film) (METTRe URL OU ON PEUT CLIQUER DESSUS????), the following graph was produced based on four different studies:

**METTRE IMAGE "WIKI_"**

This result clearly shows that the film industry is men dominated. But why is that such an issue one might ask (hopefully not...)? This lack of women representations has a large impact on our society, reinforcing the gender inequality of men doing great things (superhero, pilot, intelligent detective, scientist), and women being of secondary importance. As stated in (Bazzini et al., 1997): "Popular media images are reflections of a culture's attitudes, beliefs, and standards, as well as projections of desired realities [...] To the extent that consumers digest such material as truth, rather than fiction, the depictions laid forth by the media can be influential in the propagation and maintenance of stereotypes". In other words, what we see in movies is, to some extent, mirrored in real life.

Through this project, the gender inequalities will be assessed in a quantitative and qualitative way.

# Exploring the dataset
In order to have a better feel for the data we are using, let's explore by visualizing what we were given.

## Where does the data come from ? 
The data from which our analysis will be based consists of 42'306 movie plot summaries extracted from Wikipedia. In addition to that, some movie metadata was also extracted from Freebase such as country, language, genre, characters, information about the actors/actresses playing the characters, movie runtime and release date.
